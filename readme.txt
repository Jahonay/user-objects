                    login-page
    wanted to make a little log-in user page
    just to see if I can understand the logic
    and the troubleshooting that comes with 
    user identification and verification. 

    want to make this little project slightly
    functional. But I don't need to go over-
    board with trying to make it perfect, I am
    only trying to get a decent understanding
    and am not trying to reinvent the wheel or
    find a new way to do an old task. 

    As normal, I'm using Montserrat because it
    is the best font family out there, also I 
    live next to beverly, ma, home of the 
    Montserrat school of art, and while the two 
    are unrelated I still find it pretty cool 
    to use it for that reason, lol. 

    lastly, I'm not focusing too much on making
    it aesthetic. I have it monochromatic purple
    which looks cute to me but it's not like I 
    find it to be too amazing, it's just to make 
    it not totally white. :D
